Can oer be produced on gh? 

This repository is to try this concept.

OER may contain large files, pictures, audio or video. GH is unsuitable to host these large files. 

Having a github repo linking to these files will be a little more work but in the future it will allow these files to be built upon too! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file
